## Hi there 👋

I'm Timur, a Software Engineer based in Germany 🇩🇪

This GitHub is my personal playground — I use it to build side projects, experiment with ideas, and contribute to open source when possible.

**Main stack:**  
React · TypeScript · Next.js · Python

🌱 Currently learning: backend architecture and GenAI, mostly through hands-on projects  
🛠️ I enjoy learning in public, iterating on ideas, and keeping things simple
